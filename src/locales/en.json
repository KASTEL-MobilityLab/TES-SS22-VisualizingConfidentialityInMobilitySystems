Combined with the advance in digitalization, the leads to a great amount of collected data from the users of the public vehicles. This web-based demonstrator aims to visualize, what data exactly is collected in what situation. It also helps to understand, how big the risk associated with those data is, how long they are stored and who has access to them. To achieve this, an interactive map of the city Karlsruhe is used, where you can see public vehicles on there way through the city, and click on them, to learn more about the associated data of those vehicles and their trips.",

Then you can see the collected data and the associated risk. One the navigation bar on the top you can choose, from what view you want to see the data. If the data is not visible to the selected view, it is blurred out. If you want to know, what determines, how risky a datum is, you can click on the 'Low, Medium, High' button on the bottom left.

The data is divided in four different categories: rider data, payment data, vehicle data and trip data. Rider data are all the data concerning the user of a public vehicle, like for instance the personâ€™s name. Payment data are all the data concerning the payment of the trip, like for instance the credit card number. Vehicle data are data about the vehicle, that is used, like its current position. Finally, trip data is all the data concerning the trip itself, like the start and end time. For each data, you can see, whether they are available from different views, naming the user of the vehicle, the city and the company that owns the vehicle. A color scale shows if the risk associated with the datum is high, medium, or low. By clicking on a datum, you get detailed information on why the data is assigned to its risk level, why it is visible or not from the selected view, and how long it is stored."

Data like names, E-Mails and telephone numbers fall into this category. They can be used to directly or indirectly identify a rider. But in contrast to the high risk data, they do not contain highly sensitive information like credit card numbers.",

It can be used to identify and harm individuals. Data types like credit card numbers with their respective CCVs can be used to financially harm other individuals.",
